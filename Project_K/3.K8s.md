## Challanges in container's
```
- Provide isolated Environment
- Need to Manage Networking, Shared file System, ....etc
- 1 host for Many Containers
```
## Install K8s
```
- K8s on Docker Desktop
- Minikube
- GKE (google)
- EKS (AWS)
- AKS (Azure)
```
## Kubernetes
```
- Manage Multiple Container's within 1 or More Host
- NPC (Node-Pods-Contianers)
- Pod is smallest unit in Kubernetes
- Pod can have 1 or More Container's
- But Pod with 1 container Preffered
```
## Ex: Ship
```
container → p1,p2,p3 (Independent)
p1 can cook food
p2,p3 can Do Magic Show
pod → room
p1 in 1 pod
p2,p3 in 1 rod
----------------------------------
caption will be in → Master Node |
Pods will be in → Worker Node's  |
----------------------------------
Drone → service

p1 can serve food
p2,p3 Want Food → Can ask Drone for food
Drone will ask p1 for Food & Deliver to p2,p3

p4,p5,....p100 → Can ask Drone1,Drone2.... for Food
Drone1.... will ask p1,p1,p1..... (replica set) for Food & Deliver to p4,p5....

- Horizontal Pod Scalling
→ 10 p1 (10 replicas) // High Load on CPU/Memory
→ 1 p1 (1 replica) // Low Load on CPU/Memory
→ p1 usage > 80% // Increase Pods
→ p1 usage < 30% // Decrease Pods
```
## Kubernetes Volume
```
- Attach Storage Externally to Containers/Pods
```
## Master Node
```
- API Server
- Scheduler
- Controller Manager
- ETCD
```
## Worker Node's
```
- Kubelet (Make sure container in pod are running)
- Proxy Server (network & Communication with Master Node)
- Continer Runtime (ex: Docker)
```
